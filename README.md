# Tetris-Clone (Python Exercise) 

This is a Tetris clone made in Python using PyGame and some resources on YouTube.
The goal of Tetris is to configure blocks into a flat pattern while they fall from the sky. It is a classic and beloved game that I felt compelled to recreate and learn from.
This was a great lesson in Object Oriented Programming as well as visualization of pixels within a grid space.

## How to PLay:

```Arrow up```: Rotate block piece

```Arrow left```: Move block 1 grid space to the left

```Arrow right```: Move block 1 grid space to the right

```Spacebar```: Move the piece all the way down 

```Return key```: Start the game on the home page

```Q key```: quit the game anywhere

## Future plans for this project:
 This project is deemed complete until further notice. Enjoy my recreation of the classic and timeless game!
