# Tetris-Clone (Python Exercise)

This is a Tetris clone made in Python using PyGame and some resources on YouTube.
The goal of Tetris is to configure blocks into a flat pattern while they fall from the sky. It is a classic and beloved game that I felt compelled to recreate and learn from.
This was a great lesson in Object Oriented Programming as well as visualization of pixels within a grid space.


## KEYS ARE BELOW:
Arrow up: Rotate block piece

Arrow left: Move block 1 grid space to the left

Arrow right: Move block 1 grid space to the right

Spacebar: Move the piece all the way down 

Return key: Start the game in the home page

Q key: quit the game anywhere

Enjoy my recreation of the classic and timeless game.

## Future plans:
