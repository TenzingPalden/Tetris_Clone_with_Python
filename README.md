# Tetris-Clone
This is a Tetris clone made in Python using PyGame and some resources on YouTube.
The goal for Tetris is to conifgure blocks into a flat pattern while they fall from the sky. A classic and beloved game that I had to recreate.
## KEYS ARE BELOW:

Arrow up: Rotate block piece

Arrow left: Move block 1 grid space to the left

Arrow right: Move block 1 grid space to the right

Spacebar: Move the piece all the way down 

Return key: Start the game in the home page

Q key: quit the game anywhere

Enjoy my recreation.
